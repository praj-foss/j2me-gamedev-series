## Emulating apps

Applying the `j2me-app` gradle plugin will provide an `emulate` task.
This uses [MicroEmulator](https://github.com/barteo/microemu/tree/master/microemulator#readme) 
to emulate the generated JAR file. 

Here's how to emulate the `example/` project:

```
./gradlew :example:emulate
```

## Running slideshows

The slides are built using [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli),
which is Node.js based. We're using a gradle plugin to automatically
download Node.js behind the scenes and use it to run Marp. 

Use the following command to start slideshow:

```
./gradlew :slideshow
```

By default, the UI should come live on [port 8080](http://localhost:8080/).

## Creating new projects

To create a new project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory (for example: `pong`). This name will become your project name.
2. Include project name in `settings.gradle.kts` file (adding this: `include("pong")`).
3. Copy the contents from `example` directory to this.
4. Run it once for verification (using command: `./gradlew :pong:emulate`).
5. Sip your chai/coffee.
